	<h1>Zerg Mapper</h1>

	<p>The Zerg, uplifted race of the Xel'Naga, communicate via latent psychic
	abilities.  Surprisingly, these communications can be picked up via psychic
	antennae and recorded as standard UDP traffic.</p>

	<p>Your task is to write a progam that, given the psychic captures (PCAPs) of
	network traffic involving this fell race, determines where the zerg are
	located on the battlefield.  Some sample files are included for you.</p>

	<p>Each zerg can psychically communicate with other zerg that are within
	15.00000 meters of it.  As such, they form a mesh network of minds that can
	span the entire battlefield.  However, their psychic fields interfere at
	distances of less than 1.25000 yards, preventing either zerg from
	communicating with others of their race.  Removing one of the two will allow
	the other to start communicating psychically again.</p>

	<p>A <dfn>fully connected</dfn> zerg network includes a certain amount of
	redundancy.  Between any two zerg that are not directly adjacent (i.e.,
	within 15 meters of each other), there should be at least two disjoint routes.
	That is, given zergling A and zergling B, there are two different ways to get
	from A to B, with no zerg in common other than the endpoints.</p>

	<p>When fully connected, it may be possible to set up a pyschic resonance
	cascade that wipes out all the connected zerg.</p>

	<p>Your program should determine which zerg must be eliminated to set up this
	resonance cascade.  The goal should be to do this in the <strong>fewest
		changes possible</strong>.</p>

	<p>Additionally, Command wants to be alerted when any zerg's health
	drops below a certain percentage (default 10%).  Your program should
	provide a list of such zerg when it runs.</p>


	<h2>Packet Format</h2>

	<p><code>.pcap</code> files have a well-understood format.  They consist of a
	global header for the whole file, followed by a number of pcap-header/data
	sections.  A good reference is <a
		href="http://www.kroosec.com/2012/10/a-look-at-pcap-file-format.html">available
		for pcap format</a>.  Assume version 2.4.  Note that the <code>.pcap</code>
	packet captures provided do provide the Ethernet frame, IP header, and UDP
	header, but do not include the Preamble, Start-of-Frame, nor the FCS.
	Supporting Ethernet version II is required; but QoS data and 802.11 wireless is
	completely optional. Note that <code>.pcap</code> files may contain multiple
	captures.</p>

	<p>The Zerg packet format is already well-documented.  However, the Zerg are
	attemping a rollout of a new packet format.  So, this program should only
	account for Version 1 of the psychic format (any Zerg using the new protocol
	have updated wetware, so they will neither cause nor be affected by the
	psychic interference). Zerg only operate over UDP, on destination port 3751.
	All other transport/port traffic may be ignored.</p>

	<p>Sample <code>.pcap</code> files may be found in
	<code>/usr/local/share/instructor_share/zergmap/pcaps</code>
	on the class VM.  More may be added over time.  It is strongly recommended
	that you softlink to the directory rather than copying the files, in case
	any require updates.</p>
